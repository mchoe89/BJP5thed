// Though the figure looks to contain curves, it is made entirely of straight lines. The window is 250 x 250 pixels in
// size, and there is an outer rectangle from (10, 30) to (210, 230). A set of black lines are drawn around the edges
// every 10 pixels. For example, along the top-left, there is a line from (10, 220) to (20, 30), a line from (10, 210)
// to (30, 30), a line from (10, 200) to (40, 30), ... and so on. Along the bottom-right, there is a line from (20, 230)
// to (210, 220), a line from (30, 230) to (210, 210), and so on.
