// Write a static method named xo that accepts an integer size as a parameter and prints a square of size by size
// characters, where all characters are "o" except that an "x" pattern of "x" characters has been drawn from the corners
// of the square. In other words, on the first line, the first and last characters are "x"; on the second line, the
// second and second-from-last characters are "x"; and so on. If 0 or less is passed for the size, no output should be
// produced.

public class XO {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        xo(10);
    }

            for (int j = 1; j <= size; j++) {
